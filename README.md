### Why Github — Version Control?
[Git is a powerful version control system](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control). It is used to record and manage changes to the files over time, allows multiple users to collaborate on a project and manage conflicts between different versions of a given file.

### Exploring the Repository
For the newcomer: this space is called a **Repository**. In Github, a Repository is an overloaded term with it has 7 Tabs:

* **[Code Tab](https://github.com/Zbeyer/Game-Developers-Support-Group)** allows you to **read and manage** the files and file structure. This is where a project (or in our case multiple projects) will be stored. This is more accurately what a repository is (and what it is for) storing and managing a project's contents.

* **[Issues Tab](https://github.com/Zbeyer/Game-Developers-Support-Group/issues)** is a basic tracking system where users can report bugs, request features, ask questions, etc.

* **[Pull Requests Tab](https://github.com/Zbeyer/Game-Developers-Support-Group/pulls)** is very important when a project begins working with multiple branches:
⋅⋅* A Branch is a version of the project that splits off to make a change, or changes, independent of the main branch
⋅⋅* Branches are important on projects that need to maintain multiple states of the projects (such as when different versions exist across multiple environments).
⋅⋅* **Pull Requests** are created when the user wants to merge changes from one branch into another or back into the master.
⋅⋅* Typically a pull request includes a peer review process.
⋅⋅* More on this later...

* **[Wiki Tab](https://github.com/Zbeyer/Game-Developers-Support-Group/wiki)** is used to communicate information... it's a wiki... it's probably where this body of writing should be...

* **[Pulse Tab](https://github.com/Zbeyer/Game-Developers-Support-Group/pulse)** gives a broad overview of what is happening in the project, how frequently, who's contributing what, etct.
⋅⋅* It's an analytics tool.

* **[Graphs Tab](https://github.com/Zbeyer/Game-Developers-Support-Group/graphs)** gives a visual representation of the forementioned analytics.

* **[Settings Tab](https://github.com/Zbeyer/Game-Developers-Support-Group/settings)** controls user permissions, branch settings, and other administrative level functions.
