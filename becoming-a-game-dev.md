# Becoming A Game Developer
What you will need to learn how to do...
Special thanks to Jonathon Junker for giving a list to springboard off of!

### General Resources:
* Game Dev: http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/
* Game Dev: http://extra-credits.net/episodes/so-you-want-to-be-a-developer-part-1/#discuss
* High level programming concepts: http://www.teachingtree.co/

### Object Oriented Programming Concepts
* __Objects__ v __Classes__
* Data strucutres v Data Types
* Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction.
* Interface v Implementation
* Packages, Libraries, and Frameworks
* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/

### Master 1 language:
* C++
* Javascript (Typescript)
* C#
* Python
* Java

### Writing Algorithms
* Use sites such as projecteuler.net for practice problems.
* https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms
* Introduction to Algorithms is a book by Thomas H. Cormen: https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Second-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262032937

### Software Design Pattern
* Practice and understand practical implementations of common design patterns:
* Typescript: https://github.com/torokmark/design_patterns_in_typescript
* C++: https://github.com/john-bai/DesignPatterns/tree/master/C%2B%2B

### Learn essential programming data structures.
* http://www.teachingtree.co/
* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Binary Trees
* Stacks
* Queues
* Hash Tables

### Learn some linear algebra.
* Points
* Vectors [Normal Vectors](http://www.teachingtree.co/watch/normal-vectors), [Vector Spaces](http://www.teachingtree.co/watch/vector-spaces), [Vector Processing](Vector Processing), [Vector Transformations](http://www.teachingtree.co/watch/vector-transformations)
* Matrix [Orthographic Matrix](http://www.teachingtree.co/watch/orthographic-matrix), [3D Rotation Matrix](http://www.teachingtree.co/watch/3d-rotation-matrix), [2D Rotation Matrix](http://www.teachingtree.co/watch/2d-rotation-matrix), [Matrix Stacks](http://www.teachingtree.co/watch/matrix-stacks), [Translation In A Matrix](http://www.teachingtree.co/watch/translation-in-a-matrix), etc.
* Transformations
* Dot Product
* Cross Product

* https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/precalc-matrices/matrices-as-transformations/v/transforming-position-vector
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product
* http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CrossProduct.html

### Learn some System/OS concepts.
* The Stack
* Memory allocation/deallocation.
* Multithreaded concepts: Locks and race conditions.
* CPU registers, CPU cache, access times for RAM vs HDD, virtual memory/page files
* Keep improving your code quality
Links:
* http://gribblelab.org/CBootcamp/7_Memory_Stack_vs_Heap.html

### Keep improving your code quality
* Self documenting code (Research best practices for concise code communication) 
* Loose Coupling vs Tight Coupling
* Pure functions (broaching the subject determinism and nondeterminism)
* Recommended Book: Code Complete by Steve McConnell: https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670
* Create a small project, see it through to completion 

### Bonus points for writing some of your own systems rather than relying completely on libraries:
* Create a simple platforming game
* Write your own collision detection.
* Some people would recommend starting with a project and learning the other concepts as they come up.

### Graphics pipeline and shaders.
* Textures: Mipmaps, bilinear/trilinear filtering.
* Perspective Projection Matrix.
