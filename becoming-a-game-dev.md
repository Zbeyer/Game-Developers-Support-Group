# Becoming A Game Developer
What you will need to learn how to do...
Special thanks to Jonathon Junker for giving a list to springboard off of!

### General Resources:
* http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/
* http://extra-credits.net/episodes/so-you-want-to-be-a-developer-part-1/#discuss


### Object Oriented Programming Concepts
* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/

### Master 1 language:
* C++
* Javascript (Typescript)
* C#
* Python
* Java

### Writing Algorithms
* Use sites such as projecteuler.net for practice problems.
* https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms

### Learn essential programming data structures.
* http://www.teachingtree.co/
* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Binary Trees
* Stacks
* Queues
* Hash Tables

### Learn some linear algebra.
* Points
* Vectors
* Matrix
* Transformations
* Dot Product
* Cross Product

### Learn some System/OS concepts.
* The Stack
* Memory allocation/deallocation.
* Multithreaded concepts: Locks and race conditions.
* CPU registers, CPU cache, access times for RAM vs HDD, virtual memory/page files
* Keep improving your code quality

### Keep improving your code quality
* Self documenting code
* Loose Coupling vs Tight Coupling
* Pure functions
* Recommended Book: Code Complete by Steve McConnell
* Create a small project, see it through to completion

### Bonus points for writing some of your own systems rather than relying completely on libraries:
* create a simple platforming game
* write your own collision detection.
* Some people would recommend starting with a project and learning the other concepts as they come up.

### Graphics pipeline and shaders.
* Textures: Mipmaps, bilinear/trilinear filtering.
* Perspective Projection Matrix.
